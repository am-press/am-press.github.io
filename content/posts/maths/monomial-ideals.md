## Why monomial ideals?

A few reasons:
1. It is easier to work with monomial ideals<sup>(<a href="#endnotes">1</a>)</sup> rather than with general ideals; it is also more natural to work with monomials<sup>(<a href="#endnotes">3</a>)</sup>
2. What is true for monomial ideals is often true for general ideals<sup>(<a href="#endnotes">2</a>)</sup>; this is due to <a href="../hilbert-basis-theorem">Hilbert's basis theorem</a>
3. We can study general ideals in terms of monomial ideals

## Intro: divisibility of monomials

<p>A monomial $x^\beta$ is divisible by $x^\alpha$—where $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ is a multivariate indeterminate and $\alpha, \beta\in\N^n$ are multiindices—if there is a monomial $x^\gamma$, $\gamma\in\N^n$, such that</p>
<p>$$x^\beta = x^\alpha x^\gamma,$$</p>
<p>meaning $\beta = \alpha + \gamma$, i.e., $\beta-\alpha = \gamma$, which imposes the requirement that</p> 
<p>$$\beta - \alpha \in \N^n.$$</p>
<p>Equivalently, $x^\alpha {}\mid{} x^\beta$ iff $\beta \in \alpha + \N^n$. This can be illustrated geometrically in $\N^2$ as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> <sup>(<a href="#endnotes">4</a>)</sup>.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Figure 1.</strong> A multiindex $\alpha\in\N^2$; $\alpha$ divides all the multiindices in the shaded area. </em></p>
</div>

<p>In a way, we can say that the multiindices in the shaded area in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> are "above" $\alpha$.</p>

<p>The set of multiindices that are divisible by either $\alpha$ or $\alpha'$ is the set $(\alpha + \N^2) \cup (\alpha' + \N^2)$, which is illustrated below. The term $x^\beta$, with $\beta \in (\alpha + \N^2) \cup (\alpha' + \N^2)$, is divisible by $x^\alpha$ *or* $x^{\alpha'}$. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>.</p>

## Divisibility of monomials and monomial ideals

<p>In general, a monomial ideal is defined as follows</p>

<div style="border-style:solid;border-width:1.5px;padding: 10px 15px 0px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" id="def1">
    <p><strong>Definition 1: Monomial ideal.</strong> 
    A monomial ideal is a set of the form </p>
    <p>$$I = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^{s}h_{i} x^{\alpha_i}; h_\alpha \in k[x_1,\ldots, x_n], \alpha_i \in A\right\},$$</p>
    <p>where $A\subseteq \N^n$ (can be infinite). In other words, $I$ consists of polynomials, which are finite sums of the form $\sum_{i=1}^{s}h_{\alpha_i} x^{\alpha_i}$ for some multiindices $\alpha_i\in A$.</p>
</div>

<p>We can write</p>
<p>$$I = \langle x^\alpha; \alpha \in A\rangle,$$</p>
<p>with some abuse of notation as an <a href="../ideal-generated-by-polynomials">ideal generated by polynomials</a> has been defined to be a <em>finite</em> combination of the generators, whereas here $A$ is possibly infinite. The above notation for $I$ is meant as a shorthand for <a href="#def1">Definition 1</a>.</p>

<p>Let us first prove the following</p>

<div style="border-style:solid;border-width:1.5px;padding: 10px 15px 0px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" id="prop1">
    <p><strong>Proposition 1.</strong> 
    Let $I = \langle x^\alpha; \alpha \in A\rangle$ be a monomial ideal. Then, $x^\beta\in I$ iff $x^\beta$ is divisible by $x^\alpha$ for <em>some</em> $\alpha\in A.$</p>
</div>
<!-- ^ab259c -->

<p><em>Proof.</em> Firstly, the easy part: suppose $x^\beta$ is divisible by $x^\alpha$ for <em>some</em> $\alpha\in A,$ i.e., there is $\gamma\in\N^n$ such that $x^\alpha x^\gamma = x^\beta$, and trivially $x^\gamma\in I$.</p>
<p>For the converse, suppose $x^\beta\in I$. This means that there are $h_1, \ldots, h_s\in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ such that</p> 
<p>$$\underbrace{h_1x^{\alpha_1} + \ldots + h_s x^{\alpha_s}}_{\text{polynomial}} = \underbrace{{}\;\;{}x^\beta{}\;\;{}}_{\text{monomial}}.\tag{$*$}$$</p>
<p>The trick here is the on the lhs we have a polynomial (what seems to be a general polynomial), but on the right we have a monomial, so $h_1x^{\alpha_1} + \ldots + h_s x^{\alpha_s}$ is a monomial!</p>

<p>Suppose</p>
<p>$$h_i = \sum_{j=1}^{M}\kappa_{j}^{i}x^{\lambda_{j}^{i}},$$</p>
<p>for all $i=1,\ldots, s$, where $\kappa^i_j \in k$ and $\lambda_{j}^{i}\in\N^n$. Then, from ($*$) we have</p>
<p>$$\sum_{i=1}^{s}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\kappa_{j}^{i}x^{\lambda_{j}^{i}+\alpha_i} = x^\beta,$$</p>
<p>and because the thing on the lhs is a monomial, there is an $i^*$ such that</p>
<p>$$\beta = \alpha_{i^*} + \text{something},$$</p>
<p>so that $x^{\alpha_{i^*}} {}\mid{} x^\beta$. $\Box$</p>

<p>The following proposition provides conditions for a polynomial to be in a monomial ideal</p>

<div style="border-style:solid;border-width:1.5px;padding: 10px 15px 0px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" id="prop2">
    <p><strong>Proposition 2: Membership of polynomial in monomial ideal.</strong> 
    Let $I$ be a monomial ideal (see <a href="#def1">Definition 1</a>) and $f\in k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$. Tfae:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>$f\in I$</li>
        <li>Every term of $f$ is in $I$</li>
        <li>$f$ is a $k$-linear combination of monomials from $I$</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>This implies that a monomial ideal is characterised by its monomials. Note that a monomial ideal does not contain only monomials, but it is identified by its monomials. Convenient!</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> The only interesting part is to show that (1) $\implies$ (2).
Since $f\in I$ it can be written as $f=\sum_{i=1}^{s}h_ix^{\alpha_i}$ (for some $s$) 
for $h_i\in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, so $h_i$ can be written as
$h_i = \sum_{j=1}^{\kappa_i}c_j^i x^{\beta_j^i},$
where the $\beta_j^i$ are multiindices. Therefore, $f$ can be written as</p>
<p>$$f = \sum_{i=1}^{s}\sum_{j=1}^{\kappa_i}c_j^ix^{\alpha_i + \beta_j^i},$$</p>
<p>and since $\alpha_i + \beta_j^i \geq \alpha_i$, $x^{\alpha_i} {}\mid{} x^{\alpha_i + \beta_j^i}$,
so, from <a href="#prop1">Proposition 1</a>, the terms $x^{\alpha_i + \beta_j^i}$ are in $I$.
This completes the proof. $\Box$</p>


<p><b>Demo.</b> To demonstrate Proposition 2, have a look a <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> below</p>

<div id="fig4">
    <img src="/IMG_BE3631A23E5B-1.jpeg" alt="Ideal generated by finitely many monomials"  style="width: 55%; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p><em><strong>Figure 4.</strong> The shaded are corresponds to the monomial ideal generated by $x^2y^4, x^3y^2, x^5y$. We see that $f = 8x^5y^6 - x^4y^3 + 2x^2y^5$ is in this ideal.</em></p>
</div>

<p>By <a href="../division-multivariate-polynomials">division</a> of $f$ by the generators of the ideal we have</p>
<p>$$f = (8x^3y^2 + 2y)\cdot \textcolor{red}{x^2y^4} + (-xy) {}\cdot{} \textcolor{red}{x^3y^2}.$$</p>

    <p><strong>Important corollary.</strong> 
    Two monomial ideals are the same if they contain the same <em>monomials</em>.</p>

<!-- ^a9db48 -->

<p>Don't forget that a monomial ideals contains both monomials and general polynomials. This corollary allows us to compare ideals based on their monomials only!</p>

<p><strong>Monomial ideal membership:</strong> We now have an easy way to tell whether a polynomial is in a monomial ideal, $I=\langle m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_s\rangle$. It suffices to check whether each of the terms of the polynomial is divisible by *one* of the generators of the ideal. </p>

    <p><strong>Note: Geometry of monomial ideal.</strong> 
    We now know what the geometry of a monomial ideal is. A monomial ideal—to the extent that is characterised <em>uniquely</em> by the monomials it contains—it identified by a subset of $\N^n$. </p>
</div>

<h2 id="dickson_lemma">Dickson's lemma</h2>

<p>The following is a remarkable result about monomial ideals. It says that they're never too large!</p>

<p>Dickson's lemma states that monomial ideals are finitely generated. We can see connections with Noetherian rings and it is a special case of <a href="../hilbert-basis-theorem">Hilbert's basis theorem</a>. </p>

<div style="border-style:solid;border-width:1.5px;padding: 10px 15px 0px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" id="dickson_lemma">
    <p><strong>Dickson's lemma.</strong> 
    Monomial ideals are finitely generated.</p>
</div>

<p>The proof is important because it is constructive and reveals how to construct a finite basis for a monomial ideal.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> The proof is by induction. Let's start with $n=1$ (univariate polynomials). Then, $I$ is generated by monomials $x^\alpha$, with $\alpha\in \N$. Let $\beta$ by the smallest of these integers (which exists); then $\beta\leq \alpha$, so $x^\beta \mid x^\alpha$, therefore, $I=\langle x^\beta\rangle$.</p>

<p>In Cox <em>et al.</em><sup>(<a href="#endnotes">4</a>)</sup> they perform a general inductive step, but for the sake of clarity and simplicity let's look at $\N^2$. Suppose that $I\subseteq k[x, y]$ is a monomial ideal and we want to find (finitely many) generators (monomials) for $I$.</p>

<p>We construct an ideal $J\subseteq k[x]$ such that $x^\alpha \in J$ iff there is $m\in\N$ such that $x^\alpha y^m \in I$. This is like a projection of $I$ onto $k[x]$.</p>

<p>We know that $J$ is finitely generated: $J=\langle x^\beta\rangle$ for some $\beta \in \N$ (see beginning of proof). Then, $x^\beta y^m \in I$ for some $m\in \N$.</p>

<p>For $l=0,\ldots,m-1$ consider ideals $J_l\subseteq k[x]$ such generated by $x^\gamma$ such that $x^\gamma y^l \in I$. This means that $J_l$ is a slice of $I$ where $y$ is at a power $l$. $J_l$ has a finite basis, so $J_l = \langle x^{\gamma_l}\rangle$.</p>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> $I$ is generated by $I' = \{x^{\gamma_0}, x^{\gamma_1}y, x^{\gamma_2}y^2, \ldots, x^{\gamma_{m-1}}y^{m-1}, x^\beta y^m\}.$</p>

<p>Indeed, if $g$ is a monomial in $I$, it is divisible by all elements of $I'$. From <a href="#prop1">Proposition 1</a> and the above <a href="#cor">corollary</a>, we can show that $I=I'$. $\Box$</p>
