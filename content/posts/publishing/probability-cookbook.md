## Probability Cookbook

The probability cookbook is a collection of key results in classic fundamental probability theory, stochastic processes and more. The focus is more on theoretical probability and stochastics than on statistics. The probability cookbook is a work in progress and I plan to release a new version every few months. In this page I will be announcing new versions of it. The LaTeX source code is available on [github](https://github.com/alphaville/ProbabilityCookbook).
