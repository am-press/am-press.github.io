In brief, for 580-page book, here is my `geometry`

```latex
\usepackage[paperwidth=6in,
            paperheight=9in,
            includefoot, 
            footskip=0.2in,
            top=0.67in,
            bottom=0.45in,
            inner=0.77in,
            outer=0.55in,
            bindingoffset=0.2in,
            marginparwidth=1.1cm,
            marginparsep=2mm,
            % showcrop, showframe,
            ]{geometry}
```

I will update this with more details.
